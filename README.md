**Solandis!Tale** is a GameMaker project with pre-made code and resources all ready for making the Undertale fangame, Solandis!Tale.
It includes the battle system, the overworld system, the multi-language system alongside other various useful features.

It is originally based on old GameMaker Studio 2 versions (prior than 2.3).
We are currently upgrading the project to comply with the latest GameMaker feature changes. If you're looking for the old version of this project, you can find it in the `old_version` and `old_version_examples` branches.

If you're positive with this project, please give it a star and follow it on GameJolt (Will be on Gamejolt after development.)
